# Public key repository for Chris Bearman

You can find my various public keys for SSH and GPG here.

I maintain three sets of SSH keys. One is used for outgoing access from my home servers. Another is used for outgoing access from my portable devices. The final set is used for work.

For each key set, I maintain ED25519 (preferred), RSA/4096 bit (second preference) and ECDSA/521 bit (least preference) keys.
